teacher = "Bruce Elgort"
# Using string slicing print the first letters "Bruc" from the teacher variable

# Replace the word 'Bruce' in the teacher variable with the word 'Lawrence' and print it out



grades = [100,100,0,0,0,55,95,96,88,100,77,87]

# Print out the length of the grades list using the approrpriate Python function learned in class



# Write a for loop that iterates through the grades list and prints each list element on a new line



# Using a for loop, the accumulator pattern and the grades list, calculate the avarage grade and print it out


aRandomSentence = "I like turtles especially green ones"

# Using the aRandomSentence variable, use the .split() string method to create a list called sentenceWords
